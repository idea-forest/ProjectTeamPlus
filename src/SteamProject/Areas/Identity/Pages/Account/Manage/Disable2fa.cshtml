        <strong>This action only disables 2FA.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Disabling 2FA does not change the keys used in authenticator apps. If you wish to change the key
        used in an authenticator app you should <a asp-page="./ResetAuthenticator">reset your authenticator keys.</a>
        <br>
        Bare in mind, this only prevents a key from working here on this site. The code will still show in the authenticator app.
        <br>
        After resetting the authenticator key, you will also want to delete the account from within the Google Authenticator app,
        so that a new set up wont be confused with the old, and now diabled, code. Resetting the key here <strong>will not</strong>
        delete that key from the app.
