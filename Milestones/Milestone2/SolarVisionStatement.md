***For*** homeowners ***who*** are interested in switching to a renewable energy source for their homes or appliances, ***the*** SolarPal solar panel planner ***is*** the one-stop solution ***that*** will help professionals or inexperienced plan solar panel layouts. Depending on the user's experience, they can jump right into calculating specs of the required components or they can take a "Getting Started" quiz that asks the user for required info. The end result is a panel layout, with the required batteries and wiring runs based on the user's necessities. ***Unlike*** current online resources that only provide basic solar calculations, or potential savings based on sun exposure in a given area, ***our product*** takes the user from start to finish with the end product being a schematic they would need to DIY solar panels.
