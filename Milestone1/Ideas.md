## Team++ Project Ideas

___

### #1: Solar Panel Planner
As more and more homeowners are looking switch to renewable energy sources such as solar energy, a tool that assists them in seemlessly planning a layout for solar panels would be very beneficial. Output depending on the user's input would range from technical to financial. Such as the amount of panels required, voltages from the panels, and even wiring runs, to the money a homeowner would save on average based on panel usage and the amount of sunlight in a given region.

##### Technical Aspects of Project Include: 
* Base Azure Deployed Website Tool
* Email or SMS Receipt of Panel Layout Plan (SendGrid / Twilio)
* External API for weather calculations
* GPT enabled assistance

___

### #2: Hacking w/ JavaScript Playground
Software engineers and web developers have a responsibility to ship a safe and reliable product to their client, this is done by recognizing potential exploits in the tech stack a codebase is using and implementing safeguards to those vulnerabilities. A platform that teaches new software engineers about the current techniques used by exploiters through practice would help expand a developers understanding and in turn create more conscious design decisions.

##### Technical Aspects of Project Include:
* Base Azure Deployed Platform
* Sections teaching JS concepts such as fuzzing, DOM and browser exploits, prototype pollution, XSS
* Isolated dummy sites to test these concepts on
* Additional cybersecurity and exploit info through news API

___

### #3: Steam News / Statistics
Users login with their credentials and provide their steam id number. App provides lists of games that can be subscribed to, where corresponding  news releases are sent to phones of users. Interaction would be possible, allowing for text-based or browser-based requests of information regarding a gameâ€™s statistics and achievements. Users are also able to request public information about other users

##### Technical Aspects of the Project:
* Base Azure Deployed Site w/ Authentication
* Interactive platform for users based on available Steam API containing game and user details
* Subscription / interest based news provided via SMS (Twilio API)
