Project Inception Worksheet
=====================================

## Summary of Our Approach to Software Development
    Our approach to software development for this senior project is to use Scrum from the Agile software development methodology. The project will be broken down into sprints, with each sprint consisting of a planning meeting, daily stand-up meetings, and a retrospective at the end of the sprint. The team will prioritize and select user stories to be completed during each sprint, with the goal of delivering a potentially releasable product increment at the end of each sprint. The team will also use Scrum ceremonies such as the sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint review, and sprint retrospective to continuously improve the development process. Additionally, we will use agile development tools such as Jira to track progress and manage tasks.



## Initial Vision Discussion with Stakeholders
    Introducing a web application that simplifies the process of designing and building your own solar system. 
    With the increasing popularity and affordability of D.I.Y. solar systems, our application guides novice users through the 
    complicated process of designing a custom solar system setup with ease. Our user-friendly interface allows for easy estimation 
    of system size based on individual needs and power storage requirements to ensure adequate power during less-than-optimal solar days. 

    In addition, the application provides live data based on location for solar radiance and power generation, 
    as well as the added convenience of OpenAI's ChatGPT-powered assistance for any questions or concerns.

### Description of Clients/Users
    The clients and users of such a site would include individuals, families, and small businesses who are interested in 
    implementing a solar energy system in their homes or buildings. These clients may be looking to reduce their energy costs, 
    become more environmentally friendly, or gain energy independence. They may have varying levels of knowledge and experience 
    with solar energy systems and may be looking for a user-friendly and accessible way to design and implement their own system. 
    Additionally, the site may also attract contractors and installers who are looking for a tool to assist them in designing and 
    estimating the cost of solar systems for their clients. Overall the target audience is people who want to understand the benefits 
    of Solar energy and want to build their own Solar systems.
