Project Inception Worksheet
=====================================

## Summary of Our Approach to Software Development
    Our approach to software development for this project is to utilize Scrum from the Agile software development methodology. 
    
    The project will be broken down into sprints, with each sprint consisting of a planning meeting, daily stand-up meetings, and a retrospective at the end of the sprint. The team will prioritize and select user stories to be completed during each sprint, with the goal of delivering a potentially releasable product increment at the end of each sprint.
    
    The team will also use Scrum ceremonies such as the sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint review, and sprint retrospective to continuously improve the development process. Additionally, we will also use agile development tools such as Jira to keep track of progress and manage tasks.

## Initial Vision Discussion with Stakeholders
    App with news tracking for Steam users, will also provide achievement tracking and competition arrangement.

### Description of Clients/Users
    Users of the Steam game library and store, hosted by Valve. Gaming hobbyists interested in achievement hunting and
    in staying up-to-date with their favourite games.
