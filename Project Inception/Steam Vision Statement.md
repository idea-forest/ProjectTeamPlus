## Vision Statement

The Steam Info Network* is designed for Steam users who care about collecting "achievements"
in their video games, and want to stay up to date on news regarding these games. The app
will provide tracking, timestamps, and comparisons to other players. The app will also
facilitate organized races users may set up and compete in, which will reward users with trophies
or badges they can display on their profile, corresponding to the names of the races they've been
in and their corresponding placements. Users may also take advantage of sms-interaction which
will link to their phone and allow news (regarding games designated by the user) to be sent
directly to the user. As far as research shows, there are no competitors for this application.
